# native-weather-app
A react-native weather app

This application is able to show you the current weather for the city in which you are located. [Open Weather Maps](https://openweathermap.org/) public API is used in order to get weather forecast data. The applications color presets change according to the period of the day (day/night) based on sunrise/sunset data.

Run application locally:
- download project
- go to project directory with your preferred CLI
- run `yarn start`
- The application uses [Expo](https://expo.io/) so if you are not sure what to do next refer to their documentation or follow the instructions shown in your CLI.

This project was initialized using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
